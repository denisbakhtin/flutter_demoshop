# Demo Flutter Shop

A [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) project based on [shrine](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/examples/flutter_gallery/lib/demo/shrine).
Data is served by json [web api project in golang](https://github.com/denisbakhtin/demoshop). Everything is translated to Russian.

## Todo

Use [flutter_redux](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_redux) as a main application state manager, primarily for keeping the list of projects, and shopping cart instead of passing them as parameters.

Fix product sorting.

Add demo checkout & shopping cart pages.
